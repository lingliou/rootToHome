# rootToHome

My very first 2d game development experience. It was the result for #globalgamejam, in which me and my team spent craszy 48 hours to develop this game from scratch.

Because the theme in 2023 globalGameJam is ROOT,  so we choose our hero to be a seed and it can transform into a leaf. There are some buttons along the way that needs to be pressed for both parties, after triggers those buttons, the road will lead seed to home.

The game was developed using Unity game engine, the code in this repo is final product build by Unity, and the source code is not for public due to it's a team work.
